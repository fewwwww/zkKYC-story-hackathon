# KYCed Hook for Story Protocol

KYCHook is a syncronous hook that checks if a user is KYCed before allowing them to perform an action.

To be KYCed, a user needs to have a zk proof (generated by zkOracle) on their existing KYC status from other sources (eg. Binance, Coinbase), then submit the proof to the smart contract.

## Workflow

1. User submits a zk proof to [KYCed.sol](hooks/KYCed.sol) with [AggregatorVerifier.sol](hooks/AggregatorVerifier.sol).
2. User added to the KYCed list.
3. User can now perform actions on IPOrg since they can pass all [KYCHook](hooks/KYCHook.sol) checks.

## Smart Contracts

- [KYCHook.sol](hooks/KYCHook.sol): Hook smart contract that checks if a user is KYCed before allowing them to perform an action.
- [KYCed.sol](hooks/KYCed.sol): Smart contract to store KYC status of users, and allow users to submit zk proofs to be added.
- [KYC.sol](lib/hooks/KYC.sol): Interface and config for KYCHook.
- [AggregatorVerifier.sol](hooks/AggregatorVerifier.sol): Verifier for zk proofs of KYC status.

## Dev Guide

This repo only contains the smart contracts source for KYCed Hook.

To run, set up [the Story Protocol repo](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-contracts) first:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:storyprotocol/protocol-contracts.git
cd protocol-contracts
```
